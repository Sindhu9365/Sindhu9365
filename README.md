## 👩‍💻 About Me

🎓 Master’s in Digital Forensics & Information Security  
📍 Bengaluru, India  

I specialize in artifact-driven investigations, structured threat reconstruction, and detection engineering.

I don’t just study cybersecurity — I investigate and reconstruct attacks.

---

## 🔎 DFIR

In Digital Forensics & Incident Response, I focus on structured evidence collection and attack reconstruction using real artifacts.

### Core Capabilities

- Bit-by-bit disk imaging using FTK Imager  
- Memory dump analysis using Volatility  
- Windows Registry & Event Log examination  
- Browser artifact reconstruction  
- Metadata extraction using EXIFTool  
- Hash verification & evidence integrity validation  
- Timeline reconstruction & correlation  

🎯 Goal: Convert raw digital artifacts into investigation-grade conclusions.

---

## 🛡 Blue Team Operations

My defensive focus lies in detection, monitoring, and adversary behavior analysis.

### SOC & Detection Skills

- Alert triage & structured log analysis  
- IOC enrichment & threat intelligence correlation  
- Network traffic inspection using Wireshark  
- Exposure mapping using Nmap  
- Basic exploitation understanding (Burp, Metasploit) for defensive modeling  
- Threat hunting aligned with attacker techniques  

🧠 I approach defense by understanding attacker methodology first.

---

## 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

I apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework to simulate and analyze real-world adversary tactics.

### What I Use It For

- Mapping adversary TTPs  
- Identifying detection gaps  
- Aligning controls with real attacker behavior  
- Modeling IoT & mobile threat scenarios  
- Supporting detection engineering improvements  

Structured frameworks make security measurable.
