🧠 What I Actually Do

I specialize in breaking down digital incidents into evidence-backed conclusions.

Reconstruct attacker activity from disk & memory artifacts

Map threats using MITRE ATT&CK

Perform network traffic analysis to detect intrusions

Conduct structured forensic documentation (chain of custody, timeline building)

Build small-scale detection & monitoring systems

Cybersecurity to me is not theory — it’s artifact-driven investigation.
